# Housing Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project on a housing dataset. The notebook explores various aspects of housing data, including statistical insights, data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis.

## Repository Contents

- `Housing_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with full analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

## Project Overview

The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a housing dataset with the goal of uncovering meaningful patterns and relationships among features such as:

- **Price**
- **Location**
- **Size (sqft)**
- **Bedrooms**
- **Bathrooms**
- **Other features** (like waterfront, view, grade, etc.)

### Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading**
   - Reads housing data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handles missing or incorrect values.
   - Removes outliers and unrealistic values.

3. **Statistical Summary**
   - Generates summary statistics.
   - Explores price distributions and basic stats per column.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots.
   - Heatmaps to show feature correlations.

5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Investigates relationships between variables (e.g., price vs. sqft, grade, etc.)
   - Identifies the strongest predictors of house price.

6. **Insights & Observations**
   - Draws conclusions based on the visual and statistical findings.
